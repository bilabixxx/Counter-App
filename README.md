## HOW TO USE THE APPLICATION

By default, the counter will be set to 0 and the value in the text field to 1.

The user can change the number in the text field to any whole number.

Once the desired value has been entered, press the "+" or "-" button to increase/decrease the counter by the amount entered in the text field.
